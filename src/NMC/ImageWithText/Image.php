/**
 * Image
 *
 * This class makes it super easy to render an image with multiple, independently
 * styled and positioned text blocks. You can control these properties for each text block:
 *
 * - alignment
 * - color
 * - font
 * - line height
 * - size
 *
 * You can also position each text block using specific X and Y coordinates relative
 * to the source image.
 *
 * Currently this has a hard dependency on the `\Intervention\Image` class and the
 * GD2 image library. We will be abstracting away these dependencies soon.
