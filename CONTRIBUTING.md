# How to Contribute

## Pull Requests

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new branch for each feature or improvement
3. Send a pull request from your feature branch

It is very important to separate new features or improvements into separate feature branches, and to send a
pull request for each branch. This allows us to review and pull in new features or improvements individually.

## Style Guide

All pull requests must adhere to the [PSR-2 standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md).

## Unit Testing

We will use PHPUnit for unit tests. We have not yet written tests for this library, but we intend to do so eventually.
It would be awesome if you could help us write these.
